	* src/history.cc (append): Previously, an item was not placed in
	  the history when it was the last item. Now, if we find an entry,
	  we move it to the end of the list.

	* acinclude.m4: Added stlport detection code. When using an old
	  version of g++/stdc++ you can get this code to compile only with
	  the stlport. gcc-2.9[56] don't have a definition for
	  char_traits.
